                <h3> The Serve</h3>
                <p> A serve is crucial in the game of ping pong. This is what starts gaem play and what could easilly wind a game. to serve you hold the ball in the palm of your han, throw it up at least 6 inches into the air and hit the ball on the way down. You need to have the ball hit your side of the court first then bounce on the other side. The ball cannot hit the net when you do this. If it does hit the net on the serve and lands in on the other side, it is considered a let and you are able to redo the serve. The serve in this video is fairly basic but you can put a spin on the ball by hiting the ball with the paddle moving up to give it top spin or slicing the ball to give the ball some down spin.</p>

                <h3>Top Spin</h3>
                <p>This is a top spin hit with my fore hand. Top spin is when the ball rotates in the air away from you when you hit the ball. The effect in the air is the ball changes trajectory down. This can be useful for hitting the ball even harder because no matter how hard you hit it it seems to be sucked back down to the table (if you hit it at the correct angle). Also when the ball hits the table it shoots forward so it makes it more difficult to hit. </p>

                <h3>Back Spin</h3>
                <p>This type of spin can be achived by slicing. Back spin is when the ball rotates backwards. This causes the ball to look like it is floating and the ball does actually float longer than it would without any spin. This type of hit can be disceptive as the ball does not bounce as high and does not have as much energy as your opponent might expect, so you have to be ready or it can be tricky to hit. </p>
