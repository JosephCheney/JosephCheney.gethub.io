                <p>
         Ping-pong also known as teble tennis has caught my attention since I was littel child going to my cousin's house and just dinking around. I also joined a ping pong club in middle school and was decent in the doubles matches that we played. Thoughout highschool, whenever there was open gym I would choose to play ping poing if that was available. I alos learend some skills like top spin while I was learning tennis that directly translated to my ping pong playing and increased my love for the game. I still play casually  but now I have my own ITTF rated paddle and I play frequently with my cousin. </p>

                <h3>Brief History</h3>
                <p>Ping pong started in England as an after dinner game. It became popular in 1901 and recieved standardized rules once the ITTF was founded in 1926. This was when the rules were set and ping pong became an official sport. Ping pong is now played in many throunamets around the world and became an olympic sport in 1988. Ping pong is increasing in poplularity for the younger generation from youtubers such as the ponfininity channel and for me Adam Bobrow. </p>
