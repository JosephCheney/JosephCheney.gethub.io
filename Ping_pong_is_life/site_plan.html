         Ping-pong also known as teble tennis has caught my attention aince i was l littel child going to my cousin's house and just dinking around. I also joined a ping pong club in middel school and was decent in the doubles matches that we played. Thoughout highschool, whenever there wwas open gym I would choose to play ping poing if that was available. I alos learend some skills like top spin while i was learnign tennis that directly translated to my ping pong playing and increased my love for the game. I still play casually  but now I have my oen ITTF rated paddle and I play frequently with my cousin. 

         Ping pong started in England as an after dinner game and it became more official once the ITTF was founded in 1926. This was when the rules were set and ping pong became an official sport. Ping pong is now played in many throunamets around the world and became an olympic sport in ____. Ping pong is increasing in poplularity from youtubers sucha s ponfininity and ______.

      <h3>Rules and Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Rules
        The ITTF or International Table Tennis Federation was founded in 1926 and they are respoinsible for keeping the rules uniform through all table tennis tournaments. Some of these rules are more complicated like using specified regulation paddles, balls, and tables. Others are specific with game play. The latter I believe is more important with playing the game. You can look at this website 
        https://documents.ittf.sport/document/264 if you would like to read more into the rules.

        Gameplay https://www.pongfit.org/official-rules-of-table-tennis

        Techniques
        Topspin is when you hit the ball in a way that the ball rotates forward. This creates an interesting effect on the ball as it spins the ball goes down much faster. 
        Backspin is when you hit the ball so it spoins backward. This makes the ball have a floating effect and will not go down as quickly. 
        You can also have side spin that maks e the ball thrun mid air. This is verys imlar to a curve-ball in baseballl pitches. 

        A list of how to play and rules. Maybe a video in the page of me explining the rules. Talk about ball spin and types of holds. Types of information
